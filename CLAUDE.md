# Project information
## MaxType is
- A typing speed test application designed to help users improve their typing skills.
- Users can (but don't have to) register an account.
- Registered users' preferences and statistics (mainly typing test performances) are stored.
- Unregistered users' preferences are stored in localStorage.

## Tech stack
- MaxType is built on PayloadCMS and stores its data in a MongoDB database.
- The typing test app is (will be) built in React with TypeScript.
- MaxType uses TailwindCSS for the majority of its styles and probably some custom styles in the future.
- We try to follow TDD.
- Testing is so far done with Jest. Additional testing tools will probably be added in the future.
- Frontend form validation is achieved with zod.
- We prefer (where reasonable) to use Payload's built-in tools, e.g. for auth, user registration, etc.


# General instructions
- The user wants to learn. Be sure to explain everything you do, and why. For complicated pieces of code, be very detailed.
- For web searches, remember that it is currently the year 2025.
